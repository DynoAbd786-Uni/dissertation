model pulsatile flow. look up caretiod arery pulse flow

wss involves non trivial computations . grid build up is implicit. (just puxels not walls with normals)

bloodlfow for non-newtonian phsyics depends on shear, need to derive this somehow

set viscocity as a function of shear

100fps

target reynolds of 400

sigmod reverse, sinusoidal non-zero flow. 

density, velocity and viscocity for reynolds number 

need to kae values more realistic
